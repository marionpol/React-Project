#Event Calendar

##Base
This project has a calendar and an event function to it. You open the site and you can see dates and click on them to add events.
The events can be named and the time can also be added. After adding the event it will display a little dot on the calendar for the set date.
Also it shows the date name, time and the date itself on the bottom of the event submit form so you could see all of your events more clearly.
